## About the app
This is a simple task management application. Tasks can be assigned a category, priority and status.

## Data management
- Task related data is stored on the client using IndexedDB
- Settings related data is stored in Local Storage

## Coding challenges
The most difficult part of building this application was understanding IndexedDB using the installed idb-package.
